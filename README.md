Exploring the intricacies of language implementation through practice.

## Projects

This repo is split into a few smaller projects, each focusing on one part of language design or implementation.

### Lexer

The lexer takes an input string and converts it to an AST (abstract syntax tree).

### Parser

The parser takes an AST generated by the lexer and parses it into instructions. The parser is responsible for applying grammar rules.

### Grammar (WIP)

A set of rules that dictate the validity of a parsed instruction set.
